	<h3>History</h3>
Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.[7] According to Ronacher, the idea was originally an April Fool's joke that was popular enough to make into a serious application.

When Ronacher and Georg Brandl created[when?] a bulletin board system written in Python, the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja were developed.

Flask has become popular among Python enthusiasts. As of January 2020, it has more stars on GitHub than any other Python web-development framework,[12] and was voted the most popular web framework in the Python Developers Survey 2018.
